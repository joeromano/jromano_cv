Dear Sir or Madam:\\[1.5em]

%Opening paragraph: State why you are writing; how you learned of the organization or position, and basic information about yourself.

In response to your posting for a Senior Robotics Engineer on the Robotics-Worldwide mailing list, I am enclosing my CV for your review. I am a senior Ph.D. student studying robotics, and I am currently in the final year of my degree. I have been involved professionally with robotics for over seven years, with significant project experience in the domains you highlighted in your job posting.

%2nd paragraph: Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does (Simply stating that you are interested does not tell why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer or position to relate your background to the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make you a good fit for the employer’s needs. (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.) This is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed. Mention other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position.

I became interested in Heartland Robotics when details about the company began to surface in 2009. Although these details have been sparse, I believe the mission and technological approach of Heartland Robotics aligns closely with my own research. I was excited to see that Heartland is now interested in hiring people in the domains of feedback control and robotic manipulation. As you will read in my attached CV, I have had significant experience programming robotic manipulators to perform tasks. As a key contributor to the Willow Garage PR2 robot's object manipulation capabilities,  my code is now shipped as a standard feature with all PR2 robots. I am also currently participating in the DARPA ARM-S robotics competition as part of a joint team lead by iRobot Corp. Prior to this, I developed control systems for novel surgical robotics, and a variety of haptic teleoperation and virtual simulation systems. Through all of this work I have gained a deep understanding and confidence working with a variety of Linux distributions, as well as installing and programming real-time environments. I consider myself an expert C++ programmer, with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and years of research-coding experience integrating sensors and controlling novel actuators. %I have recently started using Python (+1 year) and am willing to send code samples for your inspection.

Above all, I pride myself on my ability to create functional robotic systems. Over the last five years I have given numerous live demonstrations of systems I designed and built myself. A variety of my work has become a part of open-source robotics projects and is used by people around the world. Most recently, my research on physical human-robot interaction was demonstrated live at Google I$\backslash$O 2011.

%3rd paragraph: Indicate that you would like the opportunity to interview for a position or to talk with the employer to learn more about their opportunities or hiring plans. State what you will do to follow up, such as telephone the employer within two weeks. If you will be in the employer’s location and could offer to schedule a visit, indicate when. State that you would be glad to provide the employer with any additional information needed. Thank the employer for her/his consideration.

I would love the opportunity to interview for the positions opening up at Heartland and to discuss any future employment possibilities. I intend to follow up via phone two weeks after the submission of this application, and I am willing to travel to Boston for an in-person meeting at your convenience.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
